Option B: Right Bundle Branch Block and Left Bundle Branch Block
Option C: Acute MI and Pericarditis
Option D: Ventricular Ectopy and Tachycardia 
Right option: Option B. Right Bundle Branch Block and Left Bundle Branch Block.  Option A is incorrect, as Ischaemic Heart Disease and Hypertension are causes of both types of Bundle Branch Block, not the two types themselves. Option C is incorrect as these are potential Causes of ST Elevation, another cardiac abnormality which occurs on an ECG. Option D is also incorrect as Ventricular Ectopy and Tachycardia can lead to both Right or Left Bundle Branch Blocks but are not the types of Bundle Branch Blocks themselves.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Question: What are the two types of Doppler measurements? 
Options: 
A. Continuous-wave and Longitudinal 
B. Pulsed-wave and Coarctation 
C. BART convention and Pericardial effusion 
D. M-mode and Three-dimensional imaging  
Right Option: A. Continuous-wave and Longitudinal 
Explanation: The two types of Doppler measurements are continuous-wave Doppler and pulsed-wave Doppler. Continuous-wave Doppler is used for aortic stenosis assessments, while pulsed-wave Doppler is used to assess LV filling patterns or to measure the velocity of myocardial tissue movement. A. Continuous-wave and Longitudinal is the right option because these are the names of the two types of Doppler Measurements. B. Pulsed-wave and Coarctation is wrong because coarctation of the aorta is an example of congenital heart disease rather than a type of Doppler measurement. C. BART Convention and Pericardial Effusion is wrong because BART Convention allows users to code blood flow as "red" towards the transducer or "blue" away from it; it does not relate to pericardial effusion. D. M-mode and Three-dimensional imaging is wrong because M-mode is a longitudinal beam that achieves high temporal resolution for a given location, whereas three dimensional imaging provides a three dimensional image of the heart, allowing for better identification of anatomical abnormalities like valve deformities or communication between chambers.

Q1. What is Bundle-branch block?
A. Delay or failure of impulse conduction from AV node to ventricle.
B. Another bundle transmits impulse in ventricles. 
C. Abnormal QRS duration (>120 ms) and ST segment abnormalities.
D. Autonomic discharges due to intense sympathetic nervous activation.
Answer: C. Abnormal QRS duration (>120 ms) and ST segment abnormalities. 
Option A is incorrect because while it mentions the delay or failure, it does not mention the conduction specifically from the av node to the ventricle as required. Option B is also wrong because it talks about bundles conducting the impulse along the ventricular myocardium which is mentioned in the paragraph but not specified as part of the Bundle branch block definition. Option D is also incorrect because it points to one possible cause of bundle branch block (ie abnormal autonomic discharges) rather than a definition of Bundle-branch Block itself which describes an abnormality in conduction from AV node to ventricle with an associated prolongation in QRS duration and ST segment abnormality.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Stress Echo

Answer: C. Colour Doppler 
Explanation: This is correct because as stated in the provided paragraph, "Colour Doppler applies Doppler to assess the average velocities of blood within a region" and "Velocities can be measured along the length of the Doppler beam".
A. M-mode is incorrect because while it can calculate left atrial (LA) size, aortic root, left ventricular (LV) outflow tract (LVOT), and ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions, it does not measure blood flow velocity. 
B. Two-dimensional echocardiography is incorrect because while this modality allows identification of anatomy and structural abnormalities, eg enlarged structures, abnormal valves or abnormal communications between chambers, it does not measure blood flow velocity. 
D. Stress Echo is incorrect because while this modality is used to diagnose myocardial viability and ischemia, it does not measure the velocity of blood flow specifically.

"Bundle-branch block and ST-segment abnormalities
Complete bundle-branch block is a failure or delay of impulse conduction to one ventricle from
the AV node, requiring conduction via the other bundle, and then transmission within the
ventricular myocardium; this results in abnormal prolongation of QRS duration (>120 ms) and
abnormalities of the normally isoelectric ST segment. In contrast to RBBB, LBBB is always
pathological. During the hyperacute and acute phases of cerebral events, including ischaemic
stroke and haemorrhage, marked ST changes may be observed on the ECG and there may
even be an associated rise in cardiac troponin. These changes result from abnormal autonomic
discharges due to intense sympathetic nervous activation, with consequent myocytolysis, which
accounts for troponin leak.
Causes of LBBB
Ischaemic heart disease (recent or old MI)
• Hypertension
• LVH
• Aortic valve disease
• Cardiomyopathy
• Myocarditis
• Post-valve replacement
• Right ventricular pacemaker
• Tachycardia with aberrancy or concealed conduction
• Ventricular ectopy
Causes of RBBB
• Normal in young people
• Right ventricular strain (eg pulmonary embolus)
• ASD
• Ischaemic heart disease
• Myocarditis
• Idiopathic
• Tachycardia with aberrancy or concealed conduction
• Ventricular ectopy
Causes of ST elevation
• Early repolarisation
• Acute MI
• Pericarditis (saddle shaped)
• Ventricular aneurysm
• Coronary artery spasm
• During angioplasty
• Non-standard ECG acquisition settings (eg on monitor)"
"Sound waves emitted by a transducer are reflected back differentially by tissues of variable
acoustic properties. Moving structures (including fluid structures) reflect sound back as a
function of their own velocity. The signal-to-noise ratio is improved by minimising the distance
and number of acoustic structures between the transducer and the object being recorded.
M-mode: named after appearance of the mitral valve on this modality, this is a longitudinal
beam that achieves high temporal resolution for a given location. It allows calculations of left
atrial (LA) size, aortic root, left ventricular (LV) outflow tract (LVOT), and ventricular end-systolic
and end-diastolic dimensions. These are typically made in the parasternal long-axis view.
Doppler measurements: the Doppler phenomenon is used to measure the velocity of blood
flow for estimation of pressure gradients across valve abnormalities. Velocities can be
measured along the length of the Doppler beam (continuous-wave Doppler, useful for aortic
stenosis assessment), or at a specific location (pulsed-wave Doppler, useful for LV filling
patterns or for measuring the velocity of myocardial tissue movement).
Two-dimensional echocardiography: the piezoelectric crystals in the probe head are activated
in sequence to reconstruct a two-dimensional image of the heart. This allows identification of
anatomy and structural abnormalities, eg enlarged structures, abnormal valves or abnormal
Communications between chambers. Newer probes can produce three-dimensional images to
better visualise defects.
Colour Doppler: this applies Doppler to assess the average velocities of blood within a region
of interest. Movement of blood can be coded red (moving towards transducer) or blue (moving
away from transducer) known as the BART convention (blue = away red = toward). This helps
identify and quantify valvular regurgitation.
Diagnostic uses of echocardiography
Conventional echocardiography is used in the diagnosis of:
● Pericardial effusion and tamponade
● Valvular disease (including large vegetations)
● HCM, dilated cardiomyopathy, LV mass and function
● Cardiac tumours and intracardiac thrombus
● Congenital heart disease (eg PDA, coarctation of the aorta)
● Right ventricular function and pressure.
Stress echo is used in the diagnosis of myocardial viability and ischaemia, to help risk stratify
patients and consider them for further investigations such as coronary angiography. Resting
images are acquired and then stress is induced, by either intravenous dobutamine infusion or
exercise performed on a bike or treadmill. Stress images are then acquired in the long-axis and
short-axis views at moderate and peak heart rates and compared with resting images, typically
arranged in a grid for ease of comparison. Contrast may be required for optimal myocardial
definition – it appears bright. Regional wall motion abnormalities such as hypokinesia,
dyskinesia and akinesia are defined."
"During the first 16 weeks of pregnancy, drugs may exert teratogenic effects resulting in fetal
malformations and drug treatment is generally avoided if possible. Particular associations are as
follows:
● ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers: oligohydramnios
● Lithium: cardiac abnormalities
● Phenytoin: facial fusion abnormalities such as cleft lip and palate
● Sodium valproate and retinoids: neural tube defects and spina bifida
● Warfarin: abnormalities of long bones and cartilage.
● Later in pregnancy, certain drugs may cross the placenta and cause harm to the fetus:
● Carbimazole: neonatal goitre (which may even be large enough to obstruct labour)
● Gentamicin: cranial nerve VIII deafness in the newborn.
2.3.2 Drugs and breastfeeding
Infants under 1 month of age are highly susceptible to the effects of drugs in breast milk due to
immature mechanisms of metabolism and excretion. Drugs that may be excreted in breast milk
and are recognised as causing toxicity include the following:
● Amiodarone: thyroid anomalies
● Cytotoxics and chloramphenicol: blood dyscrasia
● Gold: haematological reactions and kidney injury
● Indometacin: neonatal seizures
● Iodides: thyroid disturbance
● Lithium: involuntary movements"
" Oral manifestations of systemic and dermatological disorders
The following can cause oral lesions:
● systemic lupus erythematosus
● sjögren syndrome
● inflammatory bowel disease
● gastro-oesophageal reflux disease
● sarcoidosis
● amyloidosis
● HIV
● drugs
● infections
● Stevens–Johnson syndrome
● pemphigus vulgaris
● pemphigoid
● epidermolysis bullosa
● acanthosis nigricans
● lichen planus."
"Detection of Helicobacter pylori
In patients <55 years of age, without alarm symptoms, non-invasive investigations such as urea
breath tests (sensitivity 88–95% and specificity 95%–100%) and stool antigen tests (sensitivity
94% and a specificity of 92%) are recommended. (Malfertheiner et al. Gut 2012;61:646-664
● Urea breath test – the patient ingests urea labelled with 14 C; CO 2 , produced by
urease, is detected in the exhaled breath
● Stool antigen testing – detection of Helicobacter antigen by enzyme immunoassay
Serology (stays positive after treatment and NOT useful for confirming eradication) In
patients requiring endoscopy Antral biopsy at endoscopy with haematoxylin/eosin or
Giemsa stain
● Urease testing – the bacillus secretes a urease enzyme which splits urea to release
ammonia. A biopsy sample is put into a jelly containing urea and a pH indicator; this will
change colour if H. pylori is present In cases of recurrent H. pylori, culture from antral
biopsies may be used to detect antibiotic sensitivities Proton pump inhibitors should be
stopped for 2 weeks before testing by culture, histology, urease test, Urea breath test or
stool antigen test. H. pylori causes chronic gastritis and is associated with gastric
carcinoma. All symptomatic patients found to be positive should undergo eradication
therapy. Effective eradication should be assessed by
● stool testing (least invasive, cost-effective, highly specific and sensitive), repeat biopsies
or breath testing in patients with complications (perforation or haemorrhage) and those
with persistent symptoms. Tests to confirm eradication, when indicated, should be
performed at least 4 weeks after treatment.
● Relapse of peptic ulcer disease after H. pylori eradication is less than 5% per year,
compared with more than 60% in patients without eradication therapy. Evidence to
support eradication of H. pylori in patients with non-ulcer dyspeptic symptoms is mixed,
although meta-analysis data suggests that the number needed to be treated to cure one
patient is 20. Eradication regimes vary but usually involve triple therapy of a proton pump
inhibitor and two antibiotics (eg amoxicillin and clarithromycin); metronidazole resistance
is a problem in some areas.
6.4.2 Zollinger–Ellison syndrome
This is a rare condition with an incidence of one per million population. Gastrin-secreting
adenomas cause severe gastric and/or duodenal ulceration – the tumour is usually pancreatic in
origin, although it may arise in the stomach, duodenum or adjacent tissues. Fifty to sixty per
cent are malignant; 10% are multiple neoplasms. It may occur as part of the syndrome of
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, in which case malignancy is more likely"
"Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea means different things to different people but medically is defined as >200 ml of stool
per day. In lay terms, diarrhoea is used to describe increased frequency and/or decreased
consistency of motions. There are several causes (as illustrated below), and these result in
diarrhoea by differing mechanisms. Various classifications can be used:
• Acute or chronic
• Large bowel (often smaller amounts, may contain blood or mucus)
• Small bowel (often voluminous, pale and fatty).
Whipple’s disease
This is an uncommon condition usually affecting middle-aged men (occasionally women and
children) caused by infection with the Gram-positive actinobacteria, Tropheryma whippelei.
Jejunal biopsy shows deposition of macrophages containing PAS-positive granules within villi.
Clinical features include abdominal pain, weight loss, diarrhoea, and arthropathy. The central
nervous system can be involved in later stages, characterised by cognitive function
abnormalities, as well as oculomasticatory and oculofacioskeletal myorhythmia (rhythmic
movements of masticatory and other skeletal muscles synchronised with ocular movements).
Whipple’s endocarditis can also occur. Whipple’s disease remains poorly understood but
symptoms respond to extended courses of tetracycline or penicillin."

"MITOCHONDRIAL DISORDERS
(See also Chapter 14, Molecular Medicine.) Mitochondria are exclusively maternally inherited,
deriving from those present in the cytoplasm of the ovum. They contain copies of their own
circular 16.5-kilobase genome, which contains genes for several respiratory chain enzyme
subunits and transfer RNAs. Mitochondrial genes differ from nuclear genes in having no introns
and using some different amino acid codons. Within cells there may be a mixed population of
normal and abnormal mitochondria known as heteroplasmy. Different proportions of abnormal
mitochondria may be required to cause disease in different tissues, known as a threshold effect.
Disorders caused by mitochondrial gene mutations include the following:
• MELAS (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes)
• MERRF (myoclonic epilepsy, ragged red fibres)
• Mitochondrially inherited diabetes mellitus and deafness
Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (note that other factors also contribute, resulting in higher
penetrance in males)."

HUS is the commonest cause of acute renal failure in childhood. It is most commonly caused by
infection with shigatoxin-producing strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli 0157 due to
contamination of food (particularly meat) or of hands by animal faeces (diarrhoea-associated
HUS). When not associated with diarrhoea (about 10% of cases) it is termed atypical or
diarrhoea-negative (aHUS) and is most commonly due to defects in the regulation of
complement activation. Complement mediated damage to endothelial cells causes platelet
activation and adhesion with laying down of fibrin strands that damage passing red blood cells -
a microangiopathic picture identical to TTP.  Atypical HUS may be sporadic or familial. Sporadic
aHUS is commonly triggered by illness such as bacterial or viral infections, particularly Strep.
pneumoniae. Most sporadic cases can be demonstrated to have a genetic predisposition due to
mutations in complement regulatory proteins.
Treatment of HUS
Supportive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for diarrhoea-associated HUS, including
maintenance of electrolyte balance and control of hypertension, with no particular role identified
for antibiotic treatment unless the patient is clinically septic. Dialysis may be required with renal
transplantation if the renal failure becomes irreversible. Atypical HUS is treated similarly to TTP,
with highvolume plasma exchange. The anti-complement C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab
is effective (See PNH below)
Treatment of TTP and HUS
Large-volume infusion of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) (which contains the vWF-cleaving
protease and complement components) is the mainstay of treatment, coupled with plasma
exchange. The latter has the advantage of removing any antibodies and toxins involved in the
pathogenesis of the disease. Cryo-poor FFP (from which cryoprecipitate, a useful blood product,
has been removed) may be used for the plasma exchange and solvent-/detergent-inactivated
FFP
may confer less risk of transfusion-transmitted infection
High-dose steroids may be of benefit in cases with an autoimmune aetiology and are often
given
(except in the epidemic form of HUS)
Low-dose aspirin may be used to inhibit further adhesion of platelets to vascular endothelium
once the platelet count has exceeded 50 × 10 9 /L
Rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, is effective in cases with an autoimmune
aetiology
Other specific therapies may be required for specific disease sequelae (eg dialysis for acute•
renal failure)."
"The spinal cord extends from the craniocervical junction at the top of the C1 vertebra to the
conus medullaris opposite the bottom of the L1 vertebra, a length of approximately 45 cm,
whereas the  spinal column is 70 cm long. There are enlargements of grey matter between C5
and T1 and from L1  to S3 which supply the motor neurons to the arms and legs, respectively.
Below the lumbar enlargement, the spinal cord narrows and ends as the conus medullaris. A
fine pial thread, the filum terminale, attaches to the first coccygeal segment. The lower group of
lumbosacral roots within the spinal theca is known as the cauda equina.
The grey matter forms an H-shaped column in the centre of the cord, containing the cell bodies
of motor, sensory and autonomic neurons. These are grouped into zones (Rexed’s laminae).
Surrounding the grey matter are the white matter pathways or long tracts. The principal
descending motor pathway, the corticospinal tract, crosses in the midbrain. The two principal
ascending sensory pathways are the dorsal columns, which carry vibration and joint position
sense, and the spinothalamic tract, which carries pain and temperature. Light touch is carried in
both tracts and is therefore non-localising.
Ascending sensory pathways
• Dorsal (posterior) columns:
• Joint position sense and vibration
• Synapse in the brainstem at the cuneate (arm) and gracilis (leg) nuclei, then decussate:
• Sacral and lumbar fibres lie medially
• Spinothalamic tracts:
• Pain and temperature:
• Incoming fibres cross immediately or within a few spinal segments
• Crossed tract results in lamination, with fibres from legs outside fibres from the arms
• Sacral and lumbar fibres lie laterally."
